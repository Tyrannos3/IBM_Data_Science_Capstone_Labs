# Space Race Project
I have been instructed to predict the probability of a successful landing of the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch system, as this information will enable my client to assess its competitiveness, since the recovery of the first stage makes it profitable for SpaceX to set its price at $62 million per launch, far lower than any competitor. I need to gather information on past flight records and find out what factors and conditions determine a successful landing in order to accomplish my mission.
